# Publisher United

This is an [Obsidian.md](https://obisidian.md) plugin to publish notes to various sources.

Currently supported sources:

- GitHub
- Telegram channels

The plugin uses frontmatter to configure the way the note is published. In this regard it is different from Enveloppe, which uses settings only.

Publisher United has several opinions about how things should be written to be able to properly publish.

- Telegram channels
  - First level headings are transformed into bold text
